tic-tac-no-loose
================

a tic tac toe game that the computer cannot loose

the game is based on https://github.com/sontek-archive/django-tictactoe
but heavily modified since it was a two player game using redis ... so i did not fork, just tried to do justice in noting where i "borrowed"

the strategies seem to work but i would love to refactor to see if we cant make it more programmatic as there are number of "special cases" that were dealt with explicitly ...

if you were able to beat the game please let me know

have fun!
