tic-tac-no-loose
================

a tic tac toe game that the computer cannot loose

the game is based on https://github.com/sontek-archive/django-tictactoe
but heavily modified so i did not fork

the strategies seem to work but i would love to refactor to see if we cant make it more programmatic as there are six special cases ...

if you were able to beat the game please let me know

rafi (at) rafirosenberg (dot) com

have fun!
